    "In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression(*Think it in term of matrix*), where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable."
